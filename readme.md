This project is a small tutorial followup to let me get used to some commands in java.

The goal is to create an app for register students and disciplines at a hypothetical school, and manage this information as an administrator.

The application should do the following:
- ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- the user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- the student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- a student can enroll in the following courses:
  - History 101
  - Mathematics 101
  - English 101
  - Chemistry 101
  - Computer Science 101
- each course costs $600 to enroll
- the student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- to see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance
